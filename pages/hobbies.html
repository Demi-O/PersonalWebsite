        <p class="paragraph"> I just love football. I have been a Manchester United fan from the time I was able to understand the sport, just because my best friend was one but now I can say I am a true fan. In 2011 my love for football grew rapidly, I began to watch almost all games my team played and I started playing a lot more. To put it simply, ball is life. “If TV were only an invention to broadcast soccer, it would be justified.” ― Roberto Fontanarrosa</p>

        <p class="paragraph">When I am free and not doing somethig mentioned above, I am probably out with friends watching a movie, eating, the list is honeslty endless. I could also be playing FIFA, Call of Duty or a ton of other games and if I still want to play games but not with a controller then I will be at the pool table or the ping pong table. I enjoy most physical activities so as long as it is not too cold outside and I am not too busy, chances are that I will be doing something outside.</p>
